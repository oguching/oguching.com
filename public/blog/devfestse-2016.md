On November 18, 2016 a dream came true for me. There was a developer festival in Port Harcourt. It has always bothered
me that all the cool dev events happened in Lagos and there was no meetup in my city. Well that has changed.

Google Developer Groups (GDG) in the South-South and South-East of Nigeria organised a dev event in Port Harcourt with 
some of the top developers in the nation, live in the same room talking about cool technologies and software development.

My feeling about devfestse are mostly positive but there were some things that could be better about the event and I'll go
through those quickly so I can get to the good stuff.

Registration
Yes I know, it's the first time it's coming to Port Harcourt and the team worked really hard but still I think things could
be improved. Things like registration. Most people registered online but on that day everyone had to go back outside to confirm their registration.
I feel this is something that would have been done as you arrive the venue. You are confirmed and handed your tag and given basic
instructions.

Detailed Schedule
There should have been a detailed schedule of every session and their time slot. This information should be available online and made
known to participants. I signed up for the Progressive Web Apps session and the Firebase session because the appeared as options when I
registered online. However only as the sessions were running did I realise they were going to run simultaneously. Better upfront information
would have helped me choose wisely.

Come Prepared
The Firebase session had a screen but no projector so the tutor could only talk. Of course we are devs so we can always go to the website and
learn from there but it would have been cool to do a live project there instead of listening to a talk.

Keep to time
The event started quite late because the keynote speaker arrived late, so the organisers had to perform some 'gynastics' 
to basically stall while waiting for the speaker. Waiting is boring, don't make people wait.

Google Centric
Most of the technologies are Google centric. I'm a web guy but most of the talks were about how to use PWA or Firebase with Android. Material 
design for your Android apps not much about the open web. Some variety would have been better.

Ok so now for the good stuff. Did I mention that I was excited to have a dev event in my city? I still can't believe it. The main 
auditorium of The Autograph in GRA was packed full of developers. We had Google Developer Expert Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper),
Android Expert and Konga lead developer Segun Famisa, Celestine Omin from Andela, Google Mentor for Nigeria Hanson Johnson all in the
same room taking time out to teach and inspire devs down south to be the best they can possibly be. GDGs are volunteer run activities 
that provides technical help to developers. These events are organised all over the world and there's a chapter in every major city in Nigeria.



Tips
* Arrive early and get a good seat.
* depending on the venue, try to sit to the side of the main stage in the 3rd or 4th row. Sometimes guest come in late and you may be asked to relocate. When this happens in a full hall, are guaranteed to get a worse seat.
* Bring your own extension cable. 
* If possible, get a sit next to a power source.
* Have breakfast before the event. If possible have some snacks and drinks handy. Lunch is usually provided but if you're like me, you'll be quite hungry before lunch time.
* Come prepared. This is a dev event, it's your chance to impress, so come with something you've worked on or are working on that you can demo. 
* Talk to people. 
* Join a GDG in your city and be active.
