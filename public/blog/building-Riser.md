I've been working on [Riser](https://github.com/oguching/riser), a Harp template 
that will hopefully replace the current look of this site. The goals for Riser 
are quite modest:
* Two column layout
* One font: Georgia
* Large type: 21px to 24px body font size
* Flexbox

Of course it has to be responsive, bla bla bla. I want it to represent everything
I've learned about design since building the current site, let's call it v1. When
I started on v1 I had some goals but it was just taking too long to implement everything
I had in mind that I decided on a hard deadline and pushed it live regardless of
how incomplete it was. While that was great, there are things about v1 that make
me cringe.

One of my goals for 2016 is to level up on my HTML and CSS so this is the perfect
project to accomplish that. I hope I can write a bit more about the process of 
building Riser and share some resources along the way.

### Purpose
While reading reading [design in color](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/designing-in-color-abd358660a7b#.vscnqbxru)
Jonathan White talks about identifying purpose:
> Before doing anything else, first identify the purpose of your design. 
Good design aligns its color palette with its purpose.

What I want Riser to be is a bold, modern, professional, minimalist design. I want
it to be appealing to the eyes and convey a sense of confidence.

### Audience
The main audience is me. I'm making Riser mainly for me. Since I'm part of the 
JavaScript community, I want that to reflect in the design as well.

I'm taking it slow on purpose, trying to get things just right and be deliberate
about each decision and I hope you will join me along this ride.
