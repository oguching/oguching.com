Hello world. I want to welcome you to the world of JavaScript programming where we will delve into all kinds of stuff, and hopefully learn something important.

When I was starting out I didn't know anything, which is normal. We all suck before we get better.

```JavaScript
var n = 12;
return n;
```

- one
- two
- three
- eheh
- foo
- par

Yup its messing up already. hehe
