So Twitter is allowing anyone be verified, all you have to do is fill a [form](https://verification.twitter.com/welcome). You are also required to have a profile picture, a valid birthday and [more](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20174631). Finally in 500 words or less you are required to say why you want to be verified. I couldn't resist, this is the abridged version of what I sent:

> Ever since I was a little boy, I've always dreamed of having a blue tick next to my Twitter profile. Coming from a small town in the middle of nowhere, it really meant a lot to be able to stand out from the crowd and be original. Nothing says original like a blue tick next to your Twitter name, It says I respect you my bro, you're original.

This is the full, unabridged version:

> Ever since I was a little boy, I've always dreamed of having a blue tick next to my Twitter profile. Coming from a small town in the middle of nowhere, it really meant a lot to be able to stand out from the crowd and be original. Nothing says original like a blue tick next to your Twitter name, It says I respect you my bro, you're original, you stand for something, I think I might follow you to stay connected, to make a difference in the world because there are only two kinds of people in the world: those who are verified and those who are not and you my friend are VERIFIED. CERTIFIED. ORIGINAL. xoxo

I honestly don't care if I'm verified or not. But it would be cool.
