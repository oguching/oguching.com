2015 has been a great year with a couple of milestones:
* Completed my mandatory national service aka NYSC
* Learned Harp and created a site from scratch
* Bought a domain name and launched oguching.com
* Wrote and published lsdf, my first node cli tool
* Created front-end links 

I'd like to take some time to talk about each of these items.

### NYSC

[NYSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Youth_Service_Corps) or National Youth Service Corps is a one year program for all Nigerians
who have completed College or University whether they studied in the country
or abroad. It aims to promote unity through different team building activities.

There are two parts to it; the first part is a 3 week camp experience 
(there is at least one camp in each of the 36 states of the country) that includes some
para-military training. The second part begins straight afterwards, each individual
is posted to a community to serve as a teacher or medical personnel, as the case may be,
but most people assist in teaching in a High School usually in the rural areas.

I was a computer science teacher at Umuobiala Community Secondary School in 
Isuikwuato Local Government Area of Abia State. We were 5 in my batch posted 
there and I was one of the two assistant computer science teachers at the school and I was in charge of three classes.

I've never taught in a class prior to this, we had a short training in camp but it's no where adequate
for what you face in class. I observed that while most of the kids can read and write, no 
understanding of what they were reading. They struggled to answer simple 
questions that required some comprension of what they can clearly read. I also found the curriculum rather 
inadequate. The kids were learning QBasic in a school without computers or electricity, so everything was
theoretical and it sucked big time. I however loved what I was doing and actually miss those kids.

During this time I was also involved in the Nigerian Christian Corpers' Fellowship (NCCF) and eventually became the
Zonal Secretary for Isuikwuato zone. It was a tough job that involved preparing daily devotions and assigning people to give them,
sharing at our weekly Bible study, preparing reports and presenting them at the state headquarters in Umuahia, Abia State.
It was a big responsibility, there were times I felt like I wouldn't make it but thank God I did it, and I'm glad I did. I would 
pray for strength and wisdom everyday and God gave me the strength and ability to carry out my job.

### Harp
I'm not sure how I stumbled upon [Harp](http://harpjs.com/), I remember needing a server for some frontend toy projects I was working on
and discovered Harp. It came with SASS preprocessing so I didn't need another tool to work with SASS. I was intrigued, then when I discovered
it can be used to generate static sites, I was sold. Jekyll is great and I looked at it but I was starting to learn Node and JavaScript
 and wanted to stick with it.

I've had sketches on paper for years for what my site would look like but *I suck at CSS* &#0153; so while they looked great on paper
I could never translate them to a working site. I could have just used a template but that would rob me of the opportunity to learn
plus studying someone else's code makes my head hurt.

The site is simple but evolving, it is built with the help of Twitter Bootstrap and hosted on the wonderful [surge](http://surge.sh). I love surge.

### lsdf
[lsdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lsdf) is a commandline tool for listing files in a directory.
I can't imagine anyone using it, but I created it because I create lots of files to try things out
and usually would `ls` filename to see if it already exists so I don't need to create it. The problem
with `ls` is that you need to be specific and list filename.extension. I don't care about the extension 
just the name and that's what `lsdf` does. So `lsdf foo` would list `foo.js`, `foo.css` ... if it exists
and do nothing if it doesn't. At the time of writing, it has a whopping 15 downloads. *Winning*!!

### frontend-links
So I have Pocket for saving things, mostly JavaScript things. JavaScript is such a fast changing language that it's difficult keeping up with all that's going on.
I wanted access to some of the best resources that do the best job at explaining the fundamental concepts in JavaScript and that's what
[frontend-links](https://github.com/oguching/frontend-links) is. It's not going to be comprehensive, there are a lot of awesome repos for that but it's my learning resource.
There are books, videos but mostly blog posts from Yehuda Katz to Kyle Simpson, so you know it's great. Check it out.

For 2016 I have a list of things I want to learn:
* ES6
* React
* CSS & HTML (Level up)
* Data Visualisation (D3.js et al)
