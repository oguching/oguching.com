It's a jungle out there. I've been using Google Analytics for a while now and it's the 
default for anything I make, without thinking. I'm not necessarily a Google hater but
in this age of eroding personal privacy, I think we need to do more to protect whatever
privacy we still have left. Enter Piwik.

From their website, [Piwik](https://piwik.org/) says they're a leading open-source analytics platform with 100% data
ownership, user privacy protection, is customisable and extensible. Basically everything 
Google Analytics does but without the Google account and the privacy concerns, plus it's open-source
so there's that. Only one thing though, you have to host it. Enter sandstorm.

[Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/) is an open-source operating system for personal and private clouds. It allows you 
host open-source applications without having to have a server. The have an App Market where you
can download and install popular open-source web applications. Anything from Etherpad to Wordpress
and of course Piwik. Their free plan allows you up to 200MB, Piwik installed comes to almost 34MB.

From here all you have to do is install Piwik, sign up and paste the JavaScript code to your website
or Blog and that's it. Simplified analytics with peace of mind.

Of course I'm always wary of services like Sandstorm, they get bought and shut down so you might
want to keep that in mind. 

Thanks to HackerNews for the link to this [blog post](https://blog.filippo.io/self-host-analytics/) without which I wouldn't know about Sandstorm.
